## 🔍 Problem Statement

Hospitals face high costs and quality-of-care challenges due to early readmissions. This project builds an AI model to predict which patients are at high risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict patient readmission using EHR and demographic data.
- Assist medical staff with risk-based decisions.
- Minimize unnecessary hospital returns.

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Sources:**
- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Demographics (age, gender, medical history)

---

## 🧪 Model Used

- **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Confusion Matrix:** Included in the notebook

---

## 📈 Results

The model achieves:
- **Precision:** ~89%
- **Recall:** ~80%
- Demonstrates good performance for identifying high-risk patients.

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Considerations

- Ensured patient data privacy (HIPAA awareness).
- Mitigated bias by validating model fairness across demographics.

---

## 🖼️ Visuals

The AI Development Workflow diagram is available in the `images/` folder and embedded in the final PDF report.
